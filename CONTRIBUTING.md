Idk make sure your code is readable, well-documented and well-tested. The project has a `.prettierrc` so you have no excuse for poor formatting.

If you just want to call something confusing, tbh that counts as contributing as long as you're specific about what the problem is. I'd rather users be pedantic about making sure something is explicit rather than letting someone else get confused.
