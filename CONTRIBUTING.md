Make sure your code is readable, well-documented and well-tested.

If you have any feedback to give about the project, make sure you are explicitly clear about what you are referring to and offer possible solutions if you have any.

## Formatting

Formatting is done with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Make sure your editor supports Prettier, and if it has the option it is highly recommended to make your editor format files on save.

Sometimes Prettier can make source code harder to read, such as placing `>` brackets on different lines in HTML or breaking up multi-level lists in Markdown. If you come across any lines where Prettier makes the code less readable, place a comment saying `prettier-ignore` above those lines.
