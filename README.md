# fandom-discussions-viewer

This project is an attempt to implement [Fandom](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom_(website)>)'s Discussions API in an open-source project. It runs locally, so you will need the tools to run this project installed if you want to use it.

# Installation

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). It uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

## Developing

Once you've pulled this project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
