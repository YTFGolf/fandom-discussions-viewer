- Implement global stores
  - Requests. 3 options: normal (if fail then let fail), flood (retry all that failed), wait (if fail then try again until not fail).
- Proper testing
  - Mainly to avoid regression; vitest doesn't appear to like using the server's API, so either I reimplement in vitest or I do testing on the live server
  - `npm run dev -- --port 7357`
  - Can make test tab in new container so always works.
- Add stuff to editor
  - Attempt erase formatting again (can probably do some command chaining and enumerating for different kinds of nodes, or do the textbetween thing and replace `\n` with `</p><br><p>` or split by `\n`)
- Finish forumPost
  - Polls
- Add `/f/u/...`
- Add `/f/p`
- Doc
  - Split up into own files
  - notes can go in temp.md
